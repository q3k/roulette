        <p>It's a russian roulette, but for your *nix machine. Fire away, and have fun things happen to your machine.</p>
        <h2>why?</h2>
        <h3>curl -k $STUFF | sudo sh -</h3>
        <p class="lead">Have you ever though about how stupid this sort of installation mechanism is?
All these hip new software libraries do this - 'to install me, just execute this ridiculously insecure thing on your shell! oh, and if that doesn't work, try with --insecure and sudo!'. I mean, seriously guys.
Seriously.
Don't do this.</p>
        <p>A <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6650987">Hacker News</a> article and comments section already describe it better than I could - and the comment thread also sparked the idea of a service such as this one.</p>
        <h2>who?</h2>
        <p>I'm <a href="https://q3k.org/">Sergiusz 'q3k' Baza≈Ñski</a>. I usually don't do web development, so ignore the ugly bootstrap 'design' and, for the love of Cthulhu, do not look at this page's markup.</p>
        <p>Oh, and if you want to help me to forget that I spent fifty bucks on a joke domain name, you can buy me a beer. My bitcoin wallet address is on my home page, I think.</p>
